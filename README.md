# Anki workflow automation

[Little bit about](https://www.peterhrncirik.com/blog/automating-my-anki-workflow/)

Helps me creating cards faster.

### Usage

`word` : word to translate or look up

`-t` :  word type, verb/noun, `default = 'noun'`

`eng` : translate from ENG to DE, `default = False`


`py app.py word -type -eng`

## To do:

* [ ] Different output style? (currently just .txt)
* [ ] Full automation? From output to Anki
* [x] Add Selenium for sentences extraction
* [ ] Some words/verbs output is not 100%
* [ ] Automatically collect images?
